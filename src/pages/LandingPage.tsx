            SmartPatents introduces the Patent Science Decoder, a novel and interactive tool that brings intelligence to the way your 
            scientists interact with coded information in patents. The Science Decoder intelligently delivers 
            the information your scientists need while reading and writing patentsâ€”eliminating the need to switch between multiple search tools 
            and scattered information sources.

            Our app is designed to handle various ways patent codes are expressed. Just copy and paste the full patent code (include the country code)
            and our app should handle it. Punctuation and spaces are not an issue. We recommend pasting the code as written right below the bar code in the patent document.
